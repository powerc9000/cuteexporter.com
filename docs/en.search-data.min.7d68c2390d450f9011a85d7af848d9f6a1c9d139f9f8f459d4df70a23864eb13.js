If you have many files in your project the cache should increase the speed of re-exports because only the files that have changed since the last export will need to be read.\nIf you want all your layers as individual PSDs, you can also look into the cache folder for them. They are named by their asset id. i.e \u0026lt;asset_id\u0026gt;.png.
