# Creating a Project

On the landing page of Cute Exporter, click `Create Project`. 

![Landing page](/docs/img/create-project-button-click.png)

Choose where you would like to save your project file. The same folder as your raw PSD or Asesprite assets is a good place.
By default it will be named `assets.db` but you can name it whatever you want.

![File dialog](/docs/img/file-dialog-select.png)

The project file can be saved anywhere but all the assets you add to your project will be referenced relative to where your project file is saved.

{{< hint info >}}

The project file is an sqlite database file. You can read more about that [here]().
