Choose where you would like to save your project file. The same folder as your raw PSD or Asesprite assets is a good place.
By default it will be named `assets.db` but you can name it whatever you want.

The project file can be saved anywhere but all the assets you add to your project will be referenced relative to where your project file is saved.

==Note:==

>> The project file is an sqlite database file. You can read more about that [here]().
